Banking Loan Dashboard

Overview

This project involves the development of a Banking Loan Dashboard designed to provide insights into loan data using SQL for data processing and Power BI for visualization. The dashboard serves as a tool for analyzing various aspects of loan portfolios, enabling better decision-making and performance monitoring.

Key Features

Data Analysis: Comprehensive analysis of banking loan data, including loan amounts, types, repayment statuses, and sector-wise deployment.

Visualization: Interactive Power BI dashboards offering visual insights into trends, distributions, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

Custom Queries: SQL queries to extract, transform, and load (ETL) relevant data for analysis.

Decision Support: Insights to aid stakeholders in making informed decisions.

Tools and Technologies

SQL: For data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) operations.

Power BI: For building interactive dashboards and visualizations.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes information related to:

Loan purpose (personal, commercial, car, home, etc.)

Loan amounts

Customer demographics

Repayment statuses

Sector-wise credit deployment and etc.

Project Workflow

Data Collection: Acquiring raw data from banking systems or a dataset source.

Data Preparation: Cleaning, transforming, and normalizing data using SQL.

Data Analysis: Writing custom SQL queries to derive meaningful insights.

Visualization: Creating interactive dashboards in Power BI based on the analyzed data.

Dashboards and Insights

Loan Portfolio Summary: Visual representation of the total loans disbursed and their classifications.

Repayment Analysis: Analysis of overdue loans, repayment rates, and default trends.

Sector-wise Credit Deployment: Insights into loan distribution across major sectors.

Customer Demographics: Insights into customer profiles, such as age groups, regions, and income levels.

Installation and Usage

Install and set up a SQL database for data storage and queries.

Import the dataset into the database.

Write and execute SQL queries to preprocess and analyze the data.

Use Power BI to connect to the database and create visualizations.

Publish and interact with the dashboard to explore insights.

How to Run

Clone this repository to your local system.

Set up the database and load the dataset.

Execute the provided SQL scripts for data transformation.

Open Power BI and connect it to your SQL database.

Import the Power BI project file (.pbix) to view and interact with the dashboard.

Future Enhancements

Integration of predictive analytics using machine learning models.

Automation of data updates for real-time analysis.

Adding more KPIs and detailed visualizations.
